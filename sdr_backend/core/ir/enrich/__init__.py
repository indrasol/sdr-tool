"""IR enrichment pipeline â€“ Phase-3

This package contains small, *pure* functions that take an ``IRGraph`` and
return a *new* graph with additional metadata filled in.  The pipeline is
kept deliberately functional (no in-place mutation) so that debugging and
rollback are trivial.

If any stage raises *ValidationError* (or a generic ``Exception``), the
pipeline logs the error and returns the **input** graph unchanged.  This
honours the backward-compatibility guarantee: the service will fall back to
the Phase-2 minimal graph instead of crashing.
