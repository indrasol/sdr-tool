# d2json Timeout Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The server was getting stuck during diagram generation because the `d2json` tool was hanging indefinitely when processing D2 language diagrams generated by the LLM.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `d2json` tool had no timeout handling
2. When it encountered complex or invalid D2 diagrams, it would hang indefinitely
3. The Python subprocess calls didn't have timeout limits, so they would wait forever for `d2json` to complete

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `d2json` Binary
- Added timeout support to the Go implementation of `d2json` 
- Added proper error handling in the ELK layout function
- Used goroutines and channels to implement timeout handling
- Fixed argument handling to support both file and stdin inputs
- Robust error recovery to prevent hanging

### 2. Updated Python Integration
- Added timeout parameters in all Python subprocess calls to `d2json`
- Modified `parser_d2_lang.py` to handle timeouts gracefully
- Modified `dsl_parser_v2.py` to include timeout handling
- Added proper error reporting for timeout situations
- Fixed JSON schema handling to match the updated output format

### 3. Testing & Installation
- Created a test script (`test_d2json.py`) to validate the fix
- Created an installation script (`install_d2json.sh`) for easy deployment
- Verified that the timeout works correctly

## Files Modified
1. `sdr_backend/tools/cmd/d2json/main.go` - Added timeout handling
2. `sdr_backend/core/dsl/parser_d2_lang.py` - Added subprocess timeout
3. `sdr_backend/core/dsl/dsl_parser_v2.py` - Added subprocess timeout

## Testing Results
- The `d2json` tool now completes within the specified timeout period
- The tool correctly returns error messages instead of hanging
- The Python code properly handles timeout exceptions and reports errors

## Usage 
Run the `d2json` binary with the timeout parameter:
```
d2json -timeout 10 input.d2
```

The timeout is specified in seconds. If the tool takes longer than the specified timeout, it will terminate with an error message.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a robust automatic retry mechanism with different D2 parsing options when a timeout occurs
- Implement a fallback layout mechanism that uses client-side layout when server-side layout fails
- Add monitoring to track `d2json` performance and failure rates
